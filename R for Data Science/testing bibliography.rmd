example
------------------------------
Separate multiple citations with a `;`: Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].


You can add arbitrary comments inside the square brackets: 
Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].


Remove the square brackets to create an in-text citation: @smith04 
says blah, or @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.


Add a `-` before the citation to suppress the author's name: 
Smith says blah [-@smith04].


----------------------------------
You can change the style of your citations and bibliography by referencing a CSL (citation style language) file in the csl field:
bibliography: rmarkdown.bib
csl: apa.csl


> or you can use it in this way:
