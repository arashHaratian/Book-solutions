Unofficial solutions for various R and Machine Learning books

The solutions are just my attempt to solve the questions, and some of them are just an answer that I found on the internet or other repositories.

## CAUTION !
These solutions have been written from 2019 to 2020, so the questions may have been changed recently.

These solutions may contain sentences in my native language (Farsi).
